# 🧑‍🎓 UFree (Legacy) – Freelance Job Portal for Students

UFree is a full-stack web application initially built as part of my final-year university project. The platform was created to connect university students with freelance and part-time job opportunities, helping them gain real-world experience while studying.

⚠️ **Note**: This version is the **original build** developed during my academic program and is no longer actively maintained. A complete redesign and upgrade of UFree is underway [see new repo link when available].
